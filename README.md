I was passionate about coding, I had very little knowledge about coding but I was interested to explore this field and wanted to build and develop websites. I, therefore, joined Masai School which provides skill-based education rather than degree-based. At Masai School, I learned Java,spring,spring data jpa, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Learning here has helped me develop many important soft skills as well like good communication as well as time management skills.

In Masai, I have worked on many projects and built clones of websites like a clone of Uboric, Weather App, etc, and have been acknowledged by instructors and batchmates for my work and creativity.

Other than coding, my leisure interests are playing cricket, badminton, and coking.
